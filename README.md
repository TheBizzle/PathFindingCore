===============

Building blocks for constructing your own pathfinding algorithm in Scala and visually representing it in ASCII.

**This project is no longer under active development.**

For an example of its collective use, see my [AStar](https://github.com/TheBizzle/PathFinding) project, or [here](https://github.com/TheBizzle/PathFinding/blob/master/AStar/src/main/org/bizzle/astar/base/AStarStepData.scala), [here](https://github.com/TheBizzle/PathFinding/blob/master/AStar/src/main/org/bizzle/astar/base/AStarBase.scala), and [here](https://github.com/TheBizzle/PathFinding/blob/master/AStar/src/main/org/bizzle/astar/AStar.scala).
